## How it works
A cube is defined in a class (Cube) containing the position of its vertices, edges, and faces in a 3D graph. The distance between each point is 1 unit apart and each point has an assigned number from 0-7 keep track of the position. The parameters of this class takes in the coordinate of the 3D graph where the user can input the precise coordinates to place the block.
